# TrafficSignClassification

Road sign board detection and recognition systems have many applications such as driver assistance, safety information for the drivers, and automatic vehicles. There are many potential challenges concerning the detection process because of the complex environment of the roads and scenes around them and there might be road signs present in different conditions. Implementation of the traffic sign board detection system using some processing board along with a camera mounted on the vehicles. Various algorithms have been used for the detection of sign boards. 

Thus to classify data we used properties of CNNs and image augmentation. The images are all first pre processed to grayscale then equalised by their intensity. 

The accuracy of the model obtained at predicting labels of unseen data was 94%
